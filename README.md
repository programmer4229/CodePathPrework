## My App Idea
I want to build a Lost and Found app for universities where students can post lost items such as ID cards and either put contact information so the owner can retrieve their item from the person who found it or they can put if they left the item with a secure person on campus. Students will easily be able to navigate this app, find the items they are missing, and know exactly where to retrieve it. I would go even further by enforcing student verification to ensure that the people who are using the app are actually students of the universtiy they are searching. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The Swift syntax is different than what I am used to so I had to spend time researching how to use UI classes such as UIFont and UIColor. I am not used to the drag-and-drop feature that XCode provides to link UI elements to the code but after doing some research I can see the many benefits of this feature and I now have a better understanding of how to use it. I feel like I could definitely learn this new language and its accompanying IDE with practice.
